# Image Composition

**Image composition** is a technique that combines multiple images by overlaying them using an alpha channel (transparency). It is widely used in **image augmentation** for training **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in object detection tasks.

By using **parallel alpha blending**, it speeds up processing while making datasets more diverse and models more robust. This method allows the same object to be applied across multiple images or different positions within a single image, creating more varied and realistic training data.

## Applications
- **Computer Vision**: Enhancing training datasets for object detection and classification.
- **Image Augmentation**: Creating synthetic training data by blending foreground objects with various backgrounds.
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently applying transformations to multiple images simultaneously.

Using of **parallel processing** in image composition can significantly reduce computation time.
