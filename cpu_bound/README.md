# CPU-Bound Approach

This project implements a **CPU-bound approach** to image composition, applying **parallel processing** to accelerate intensive augmentations applied to images. 

The goal is to **optimize CPU utilization** by applying transformations such as:
- **Blurring** 
- **Sharpening**
- **Edge Detection** 
- **Transformation**
- **Histogram Equalization**

while simultaneously **placing an overlay image (a cat) onto background images of streets**.
